# University of Minnesota Coding Boot Camp - Fall 2020 
## Assignment #08 Portfolio Update: Professional Materials
<br/>

### Overview

The focus of this assignment was to updated our previously-created portfolios to include a number of new features, including links in our "examples" section highlighting work we've done.  These were the homework's posted minimum requrements:

* Submit an updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.

* Submit an updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments.

* Submit an updated resume

* Submit an updated LinkedIn profile


### Review of Tasks

While the premise of the assignment was to update our existing portfolios with new features, I opted to take the oppotunity to re-build the site from scratch.

I believe one of our Teacher's Assistants said in class today that you'll never been happy with your portfolio, and I agree.  My first iteration was terrible, and while this one is a lot better, I know within myself, I still have a long way to go.  I am proud of this iteration, but I am already looking forward to its next look.

I'm most proud of the integration of the "Typed" animation, thanks to:

https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/

It's very easy to use and adds an instant layer of "cool" to your bland, newbie portfolio.

In addition to updating our portfolio, this week's homework assignment also saw the updating of the student's resumes, Github and LinkedIn profiles.


#### Here are the steps taken to achieve this complete this week's homework project:

* Built initial file system structure and deployed basic blueprint to Github to complete repository construction.
* Sketched out pseudo code logic and transcribed them into the code as comments.
* Researched other portfolio sites to garner inspiration
* Researched "typed.js" plugin as seen on another site.
* Updated Resume
* Updated Github profile, added pinned projects, and followed fellow students to build network.
* Updated LinkedIn profile.
* Took screenshots of existing projects for portfolio.

*After multiple trial and error debugging sessions, all applied logic appears sound and no bugs can be generated from purposeful negligent entries.  From this point, it was time to clean up:*

* Refactor reduntant and worthless code.
* Removed multiple, annoying console.log commands used for debugging.
* Double-checked to ensured code was properly formatted and commented before submission.
* Used code validation service.
* Wrote README.MD file.
* Added screenshots to README.
 

### Installation

Installation should be fairly straightforward, but here's a quick guide to get up and running, assuming you have **Visual Studio Code** and **Git** (with the accompanying interface **Git Bash**) installed.

* from your shell input the command: `git clone https://github.com/infiniteoo/homework_week_08_updated_portfolio`
* once downloaded, from the working directory in the shell, input the command: `code .`
